# Tkinter Python GUI Project
# Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Tkinter, the standard GUI toolkit in Python, to create desktop applications. Tkinter offers a wide range of tools for building interactive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) easily and efficiently.

# Features
Basic GUI Components: Create windows, labels, buttons, and other fundamental GUI elements.
Event Handling: Manage user interactions such as button clicks and keyboard events.
Image Handling: Display and manipulate images using the Pillow library with Tkinter.
Layout Management: Arrange widgets using Tkinter’s geometry managers, including pack, grid, and place.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pillow library (for image handling)
Install Required Packages
Ensure Python is installed on your system. Install the Pillow library using pip by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install Pillow
Getting Started
Running the Example
To run a sample Tkinter application:

Save the provided script to a file (e.g., app.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the file.
Execute the script using Python.
This will open a window demonstrating basic Tkinter functionality.

# Handling Images
You can use the Pillow library to manage images within Tkinter applications. Load images and display them using Tkinter’s Label widget or other suitable widgets.

# Layout Management
Tkinter offers various layout managers to organize widgets:

pack(): Adds widgets to the parent widget in a block format.
grid(): Arranges widgets in a grid format with rows and columns.
place(): Places widgets at absolute positions or relative to the parent widget’s size.
